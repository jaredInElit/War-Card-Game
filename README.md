# War-Card-Game
A automated version of the card game war.
Running the code will cause a deck of 52 cards to be shuffled and then evenly dealt to each player.
The system will draw each card, compare them, and then print the cards drawn and which player wins to the console.
At the end, the system will tally the score count of each player and print the winner.
